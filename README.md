# ToDo List Web Application

## Project Description

The ToDo List Web Application is a simple task management system developed using Node.js, Express.js, and EJS. The primary goal of the project is to provide users with a platform to create, view, and manage their tasks efficiently. Unlike more complex task management applications, this version does not use a database to persist tasks between sessions.

### Example

An example of the application can be found [here]().

## Deliverables

The project includes the following components:

- One Node.js project for the functionality of the website.
- At least one EJS file for the structure of the website.
- At least one CSS file for the styling of the website.

## Features

1. **Task Creation**: Users can easily create new tasks through a user-friendly interface.

2. **Task Viewing**: Users have the ability to view a comprehensive list of all their tasks.

3. **Task Completion**: Completed tasks can be visually identified by striking through the respective entries in the todo list. Tasks are not automatically deleted to maintain a record of completed items.

4. **Segmented Lists**: Users can organize tasks into at least two lists, one for the day's tasks and another for work-related tasks, providing a structured approach to task management. (Refer to the [example website](https://capstone-todo-example-003d0a7ff60a.herokuapp.com/)).

5. **Styling**: The application is well-styled and responsive, ensuring a seamless user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Technical Requirements

1. **Node.js & Express.js**: The application is built as a web server using Node.js and Express.js. Express.js handles routing and middleware for efficient web communication.

2. **EJS**: EJS serves as the templating engine, dynamically generating HTML based on the application's state.
